# Description
You step into a constricted floor where every movement and operation is limited. Commands are few, space is tight, and options are restricted.

A guardian looms over the floor, its body shifting like liquid metal, enforcing these constraints. It watches your every move, daring you to make do with what you have and uncover the passcode to the next floor despite the restrictions.

# My solve
I solved this by running just octal escape codes that runs exec("system('cat pyjail_challenge.py')").
