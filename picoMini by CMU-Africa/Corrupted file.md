# Description
This file seems broken... or is it? Maybe a couple of bytes could make all the difference. Can you figure out how to bring it back to life? 

# Solve
Ran hexedit on the file saw JFIF then saw that the starting bytes were not `FF D9` so changed it to that. Got an image with the flag in it.

Flag : `picoCTF{r3st0r1ng_th3_by73s_b67c1558}`
